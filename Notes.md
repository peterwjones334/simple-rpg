## Developer Guidance

Determine the core "mechanic" of the game first. For exmaple a roll dice above or below a threshold value. This is the baseline for how the other factors integrate. My strong suggestion is that the core mechanic design is kept simple, so it is easy to learn and isn't a blocker for players.

Define the "modifiers" which are anything that affect the result of the core mechanic. These "modifiers" include character types, skills & abilities, equipment, impacts & outcomes, creatures, books & spells, which change the chance of success of the core mechanic. Modifiers are added or substracted and imapct the probility of a successful outcome, opersting as a technical control to retain the characters within the game.

Develop "effects" which  are the result from successful checks (dice rolls), or occur by due to structured Referee or Player decisions that result in a 'something' happening. For example character damage or influencing opponents actions.

Check "License", typically you may be reverse enginering or re-using core mechanics, modifiers and effects, which is inevitable for basic concepts in common use within a 50+ year old industry, and as a consequence you may be creating derivative works of existing Commercial or Open Source property. Please either acknowldge, or seek written permission, as requsted of the owner of the source material(s). Consider the outputs a hobby or interest, you are very unlikley to derive a signifcant income from your efforts, and even less likley if you are subject to proceeding resulting from alleged copyright infingement or theft of Intellectual Property.

Define a "Scenario". This provides the reason to play the games and give the value to the players. The scenario should work within the mechanic, may include exclusion or additions to modifiers and effects, with the intent to provide the players who completing a structured course of actions with reward. The reward(s) may be modifier or entry into another scernario. The scenario should also be checked for derivative works and licensed, as appropriate, if it is intended for publication and commercial distribution.

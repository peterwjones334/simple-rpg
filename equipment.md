# Equipment

Every new character starts with some basic equipment; set of clothes, one day rations and a one-handed weapon, as allowed by their class.

Characters have a purse which contains 1d6 x 10 coins with which to buy equipment.

Equipment is bought from NPC in a shop, stolen or traded with another character.

All Equipment is consumable and has limited use. When that item is used the next (turn) its Usage die is rolled. If the roll is 1-2 then the benefit is lost. Usage is downgraded with continue use.

A character can carry the number of items equal to their STR with no issues. Carrying over this amount means they are encumbered, and all attribute checks are taken with disadvantage - you can also only ever move to somewhere Nearby. They simply cannot carry more than double their STR.

Armor provides protection by reducing all incoming damage. Each type will reduce damage by a limited amount. Armor Points are regained after rest. Once the characters armor has absorbed its maximum HP, the Character is too tired or wounded to make effective use of it again - they then begin taking full damage. If a character wears armor that is not listed in their class, they add their total Armor points to any rolls to Attack or Avoid Damage.

Larger, more deadly weapons deal additional damage, but are also harder to hit with. Add +2 to any dice rolled with them.

When using a weapon not listed in their class, combat checks have Disadvantage.

Creatures have 1 point of armor for every HD above 1, to figure this out quickly simply -1 from their HD -- Human based creatures can also carry shields. (All to a maximum of 10).

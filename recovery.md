Rest and Healing

When the fight is over/are out of danger, a character that is taken OOA can roll 2d6 on the table to see what happens to them. If they survive, they gain 1d6-2 HP.
Roll	
2	Knocked out
3-5	Concuss, Disadvantage on all checks for the next hour.         
6-8	Physically Stressed. STR, DEX and CON are -2 for the next day. 
9-10	Physically Impaired .STR or DEX is permanently reduced by 2
11	Disfigured or Traumatically shocked - CHA reduced to 4
12	Dead

If all the characters lose the fight or are unable to recover the body of the character, they are lost (Dead)
When characters rest for about an hour, they regain the use of all their Armor points. Also once per day, after resting, they may roll a Hit Die associated with their class and regain that many HP.
Characters can gain Hit Points from Spells, Potions, and Abilities. They can never gain more than their maximum - and can never go below zero either. When healing a character who is OOA, just start at zero and count up. That character is now back on their feet and no longer OOA.

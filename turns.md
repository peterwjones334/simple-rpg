Turn, Time, Movement, Encounters & Reactions

During a player’s turn a character may move and perform an action. They could attack, look for a clue, talk with an NPC, cast a spell - interacting with the world is an action. Often, they will check their attributes to determine the outcome.
There are 2 types of tracked time - Moments (rounds) and Minutes (turns). Moments are used during combat and fast paced scenes of danger and Minutes are used when exploring and adventuring. A GM may advance the clock as they need substituting Minutes for Hours, Days or even Months, should the game require it.
Movement uses ranges for measuring distances; Close, Nearby, Far Away and Distant. On their turn every character can move somewhere Nearby as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of the move. They can forgo their action and move somewhere Far Away instead. Anything beyond Far Away can be classified as Distant and would take 3 moves to get to.
This supports the narrative ‘theatre of the mind’ style of play and is less concerned about tracking squares and distances. For converting existing movement rates or measures use the following.
Close	0-5 ft
Nearby	5 -60 ft
Far Away	60ft -120 ft

Some creatures and NPCs will have pre-determined personalities and goals that will guide a GM when choosing their actions towards the characters.
When the characters are on travelling, The GM should roll a 1d6 every 20 minutes of real-world play. A result of 1-2 means the players will encounter a randomly generated creature or distraction in the next turn. Randomly encountered creatures will react to the characters, make a 2d6 Reaction roll.

Roll	Reaction
1-2	Flee
2-6	Avoid
7-8	Confront and Call for Reinforcements
9	Confront and attempt to capture, kill or Eat the Character
10	Mistake the PC for friends or Trick the PC (re-reroll)
11-12	Provide assist, usually trade items or information 

The likelihood of a meeting, and to some extent the reaction, will depending on the terrain, time of day and outcomes of previous encounters.

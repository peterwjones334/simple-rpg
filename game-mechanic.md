Game Mechanic
The Game Master creates a world. The world consists of characters, non-player characters, creatures, equipment, location and objectives. 
The player uses a character to perform actions, equipment, combat and casting to interact with the world and achieve objectives.
Characters have an initial class, attributes and skills.
The outcome of a character action is resolved by checking an attribute.
A player should roll below the attribute on a d6 to pass.
Typically, creatures donâ€™t make checks - a character must avoid their attacks by making a check, the only time a creature would roll is for damage.
The game is played in turns.
The games end when the objectives are met (or the characters are dead). The GM awards experience allowing the characters to gain levels for future games in the world.

Books

The Knowledge skill allows the player of the character to use their faith, innate or learned or abilities to pray or cast a “spell” that is chosen from a list in their book. They can cast what they know by reading from a book (or can memorize from a book) equal to their Level.
They have several 'slots' that they can cast each day. These represent a user's 'energy' and the taxing nature of casting.  When they run out of slots, they cannot cast.

Once a spell is cast it should be checked against their WIS/INT - adding its level to the roll. If they fail, then they reduce the number of 'slots' corresponding to the spell level just cast by 1. When a memorized spell is cast it is not forgotten.
After roughly 8 hours rest, the number of 'slots' a character has refreshes to its maximum.
Magic weapons add +1 to any attribute being checked whilst using the weapon and +1 to each damage dice rolled. More powerful weapons (+2/3) at the GM discretion.
Magic applies to armor adds to its AP. It operates per the normal AP rules.
Traditional OSR games deal with magic items by adding +1 or +2 to attack rolls and AC. If the GM intends to give out stronger magic armor (+2/3) to high level players, carefully consider tripling the Armor Points.
If a spell calls for a creature to make a save, the character must check their INT or WIS - to see if the magic cast was powerful enough to overcome their defenses (remember the Powerful Opponents rule).

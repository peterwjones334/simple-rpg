# Advantage, Initiative & Combat

A GM may decide that a particular course of action or task has a higher or lower chance of success. They should ask a player to roll an additional 3d6 when making a check - with advantage the lower result is used and with disadvantage, the higher.

If combat breaks out, everyone must be sorted into an order so they each get to act and react in turn. Every character checks their DEX, those that succeed, take their turn before their opponents, they must then act as a group - deciding their own order for actions. Those that fail their DEX checks, go after their opponents.

When a character attacks a creature, they must roll below their STR stat for a Melee Attack or DEX for a Ranged Attack. Likewise, when a creature attacks, the character must roll below its STR against a Melee Attack and DEX against a Ranged Attack to avoid taking damage. A GM will often give the stat required for the check. The damage an attack deals is based on the character's class or the number of HD a creature has.

To make a Melee Attack an opponent must be Close. Ranged Attacks against Close opponents are possible, but the attacker suffers a Disadvantage.

Creatures deal damage based on their HD.

If a player making an attack rolls a 1, they double the result of the damage dice they roll. If they roll a 20 when avoiding an attack, they take double damage. Armor Points are used normally.

For every HD above the character's level, add +1 to every roll the player makes for any attribute check that would determine the outcome of a conflict between them and an NPC. For example, a level 3 character defending against a HD 5 creatures attack would add +2 to their roll.

The player should roll an attribute check when any spell, trap or effect would impact them.

When a character is reduced to zero Hit Points (HP) they are taken Out of Action (OOA), they are unconscious and cannot make any actions.

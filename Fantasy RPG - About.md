## Fantasy RPG - About

## Dungeons & Dragons

Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a fantasy role-playing game created by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson around 1974. It is considered to be the original role-playing game and has been the inspiration for many other games since its inception. D&D is a cooperative game where players create characters, explore imaginary worlds, and battle monsters and villains. The game is played with dice, miniatures, and paper maps.

At its core, D&D is a storytelling game. Players create characters that represent them in the game world. These characters have unique abilities, skills, and personalities that are determined by the player’s choices during character creation. Players then use these characters to explore imaginary worlds filled with monsters, villains, and other challenges. As they progress through the game, players gain experience points which can be used to improve their character’s abilities.

The rules of D&D are divided into three main parts: character creation, combat rules, and dungeon exploration rules. Character creation involves creating a character’s race (human, elf, dwarf etc.), class (fighter, wizard etc.), background (noble or peasant), and alignment (good or evil). Combat rules determine how attacks are resolved between characters and monsters using dice rolls. Dungeon exploration rules provide guidance on how to navigate dungeons filled with traps and puzzles as well as how to interact with non-player characters such as merchants or guards.

The most important part of D&D is the story that emerges from playing the game. Players work together to create an exciting narrative as they explore dungeons and battle monsters. The story can be as simple or complex as the players wish it to be; it can involve epic battles against powerful foes or small adventures in search of treasure. No matter what type of story emerges from playing D&D, it will always be an exciting journey full of surprises.

Over the years, the game has gone through several editions, each with its own unique set of rules and mechanics. The two most popular editions published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc. (WotC) are 3.5e and 5e, which were released in 2003 and 2014 respectively. WotC has published numerous spin-off products, including board games, novels, video games as well as tv, films and online media.

## Open Game License (OGL)

The Open Game License (OGL) is a legal instrument created by Wizards of the Coast, Inc. (WotC) that allows third-party publishers to create and publish content based on WotC's intellectual property, such as Dungeons & Dragons. The OGL was first introduced in 2000 with the release of the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons. It was designed to provide a legal framework for third-party publishers to create and publish content based on WotC's intellectual property without fear of copyright infringement.

The OGL grants third-party publishers the right to use certain elements from WotC's intellectual property, such as game mechanics, character classes, spells, and monsters. These elements are referred to as "Open Game Content" (OGC). Third-party publishers can then create their own content based on these elements and publish it under the OGL. This allows them to create new products without having to obtain a specific commercial license from WotC or pay royalties.

The OGL also includes provisions that protect WotC's intellectual property from being used in ways that could be detrimental to their business interests. For example, it prohibits third-party publishers from using any of WotC's trademarks or logos without permission. It also requires that any product published under the OGL must include a statement indicating that it contains Open Game Content and must list all of the sources from which the Open Game Content was taken.

Since its introduction the OGL has become an important part of the tabletop gaming industry. It has allowed third-party publishers to create new products based on popular intellectual properties without having to obtain a license from the original publisher or pay royalties. This has resulted in an explosion of creativity and innovation within the tabletop gaming industry, as well as increased competition between different publishers. The OGL has also helped make tabletop gaming more accessible by allowing anyone with access to a computer and internet connection to create their own content based on popular intellectual properties.

## System Reference Documents (SRD)

A System Reference Document (SRD) is a document used to publish the rules of a role-playing game (RPG). It is typically created by the game's publisher and released to the public, allowing anyone to create content for the game without having to pay a licensing fee. The SRD contains all of the core rules of the game, including character creation, combat, magic, and other mechanics. It also includes information about setting and worldbuilding, as well as guidelines for creating new content.

The SRD is an important tool for game designers and publishers. It allows them to provide a consistent set of rules that can be used by anyone who wants to create content for their game. This helps ensure that all content created for the game is compatible with each other and with the core rules of the game. It also makes it easier for players to learn how to play the game, since they can refer to a single source of information instead of having to search through multiple books or websites.

The SRD typically includes all of the core rules of the game, such as character creation, combat, magic, and other mechanics. It also includes information about setting and worldbuilding, as well as guidelines for creating new content. The SRD may also include additional material such as sample characters or adventures. This additional material can be used by players or GMs as inspiration when creating their own content.

The SRD is usually released in PDF format so that it can be easily shared online or printed out for use at home or at gaming conventions. Some publishers may also release an HTML version of their SRD so that it can be viewed on any device with an internet connection. The SRD should always include a copyright notice so that people know who owns the rights to the material contained within it.

When using an SRD, it is important to remember that it only covers the core rules of the game and does not include any additional material such as adventures or settings. If you want to create your own content based on an existing RPG system, you will need to purchase any additional materials from the publisher or find them elsewhere online. Additionally, some publishers may have specific terms and conditions regarding how their SRDs can be used; make sure you read these carefully before using any material from an SRD in your own work.

## **Old School Revival (OSR)**

OSR (Old School Revival) role-playing games are a type of tabletop role-playing game that seeks to recreate the experience of playing classic role-playing games from the 1970s and 1980s. These games typically feature simple rules, minimal character customization, and a focus on exploration and discovery. OSR games often draw inspiration from classic fantasy literature, such as J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings or Robert E. Howard’s Conan stories.

The OSR movement began in the early 2000s as a reaction to the increasing complexity of modern role-playing games. Many gamers felt that modern RPGs had become too focused on rules and mechanics, and had lost sight of the sense of exploration and discovery that made classic RPGs so appealing. As a result, they sought to create new games derived from the System Reference Documents (SRD) and Open Gaming License (OGL) that attempted recaptured the spirit of classic RPGs while still providing an enjoyable gaming experience.

One of the defining features of OSR games is their focus on player creativity and improvisation. Unlike many modern RPGs, which provide detailed rules for every situation, OSR games often leave much up to the players’ imaginations. This encourages players to come up with creative solutions to problems, rather than relying on pre-defined rules or mechanics. It also allows for more dynamic storytelling, as players can react to unexpected events in ways that would be impossible in more structured systems.

Many OSR games use of random elements to create an unpredictable gaming experience. OSR games use dice rolls or other randomizers to determine outcomes, creating an element of chance that keeps players guessing about what will happen next, helping keep players engaged and encourages them to think outside the box when it comes to problem solving.

Finally, OSR games often emphasize story over mechanics or rules. While there are still rules governing how characters interact with each other and their environment, these rules are often secondary to the narrative being created by the players themselves. This allows for more immersive storytelling experiences than those found in more structured systems, as players can shape their own stories without worrying about adhering strictly to predetermined rules or mechanics.

Overall, OSR role-playing games offer a unique gaming experience that emphasizes player creativity and improvisation over strict adherence to pre-defined rules or mechanics. By allowing for more dynamic storytelling experiences and introducing elements of chance into gameplay, these games provide an exciting alternative to more structured systems while still providing plenty of opportunities for exploration and discovery.

# Simple Role-Playing Game

SRPG v1

## Overview

This document provides a simple roleplaying game which is played with
paper, pencils and dice (d6).

It uses early Fantasy Roleplaying Game as a baseline and changes aspects
to make it lite and generic.

## Game Mechanic

The Game Master (GM) creates a world. The world consists of characters,
non-player characters (NPC), creatures, equipment, location and
objectives.

The player uses a character to perform actions, equipment, combat and
casting to interact with the world and achieve objectives. Characters
have an initial class, attributes and skills.

The outcome of a character's action is resolved by checking an
attribute.

**A player should roll below the attribute on a d6 to pass**.

Creatures don't make checks - a character must avoid their attacks by
making a check, the only time a creature would roll is for damage.

The game is played in turns.

The game ends when the objectives are met (or the characters are dead).
The GM awards experience allowing the characters to gain levels for
future games in the world.

## Characters

The player choices of their character class from either; Manual Skilled,
Combat Skilled & Knowledge Skilled.

The class determines how much damage you can do, your Hit Points (HP)
and unique abilities.

The values for attributes are generated with a d6 in the following
order.

- Strength (STR)

- Dexterity (DEX)

- Constitution (CON)

- Intelligence (INT)

- Wisdom (WIS)

- Charisma (CHA)

2 of the generated attributes may be swapped around.

### Combat skilled ("Warrior" or "Fighter") Class

The Combat skill modifies the basic attributes using the assumption that
the character has acquired addition STR & DEX through practice and
training of combat skills.

All Equipment is consumable and has limited use. When that item is used
the next (turn) its Usage die is rolled. If the roll is 1-2 then the
benefit is lost. Usage is downgraded with continue use.

A character can carry the number of items equal to their STR with no
issues. Carrying over this amount means they are encumbered, and all
attribute checks are taken with disadvantage - you can also only ever
move to somewhere Nearby. They simply cannot carry more than double
their STR.

Armor provides protection by reducing all incoming damage. Each type
will reduce damage by a limited amount. Armor Points are regained after
rest. Once the characters armor has absorbed its maximum HP, the
Character is too tired or wounded to make effective use of it again -
they then begin taking full damage. If a character wears armor that is
not listed in their class, they add their total Armor points to any
rolls to Attack or Avoid Damage.

Larger, more deadly weapons deal additional damage, but are also harder
to hit with. Add +2 to any dice rolled with them.

When using a weapon not listed in their class, combat checks have
Disadvantage.

Creatures have 1 point of armor for every HD above 1, to figure this out
quickly simply -1 from their HD -- Human based creatures can also carry
shields. (All to a maximum of 10).

## Turn, Time, Movement, Encounters & Reactions

During a player's turn a character may move and perform an action. They
could attack, look for a clue, talk with an NPC, cast a spell -
interacting with the world is an action. Often, they will check their
attributes to determine the outcome.

There are 2 types of tracked time - Moments (rounds) and Minutes
(turns).

- Moments are used during combat and fast paced scenes of danger.

- Minutes are used when exploring and adventuring.

A GM may advance the clock as they need substituting Minutes for Hours,
Days or even Months, should the game require it.

Movement uses ranges for measuring distances; Close, Nearby, Far Away
and Distant.

On their turn every character can move somewhere Nearby as part of an
action, performing that action at any stage of the move. They can forgo
their action and move somewhere Far Away instead. Anything beyond Far
Away can be classified as Distant and would take 3 moves to get to.

This supports the narrative 'theatre of the mind' style of play and is
less concerned about tracking squares and distances. For converting
existing movement rates or measures use the following.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------;
  **Distance**            **Feet**                **Meters**
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------;
  Close                   0 - 5                   0 - 2

  Nearby                  5 - 60                  2 - 20

 Far Away                60 -120                 20 - 50
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------;

Some creatures and NPCs will have pre-determined personalities and goals
that will guide a GM when choosing their actions towards the characters.

When the characters are on travelling, The GM should roll a 1d6 every 20
minutes of real-world play. A result of 1-2 means the players will
encounter a randomly generated creature or distraction in the next turn.
Randomly encountered creatures will react to the characters, make a 2d6
Reaction roll.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------;
  **Result**   **Reaction**
  ------------ ------------------------------------------------------------;
  1-2          Flee

  2-6          Avoid

  7-8          Confront and Call for Reinforcements

  9            Confront and attempt to capture, kill or Eat the Character

  10           Mistake the PC for friends or Trick the PC (re-reroll)

 11-12        Provide assist, usually trade items or information
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------;

The likelihood of a meeting, and to some extent the reaction, will
depending on the terrain, time of day and outcomes of previous
encounters.

## Advantage, Initiative & Combat

A GM may decide that a particular course of action or task has a higher
or lower chance of success. They should ask a player to roll an
additional 3d6 when making a check - with advantage the lower result is
used and with disadvantage, the higher.

If combat breaks out, everyone must be sorted into an order so they each
get to act and react in turn. Every character checks their DEX, those
that succeed, take their turn before their opponents, they must then act
as a group - deciding their own order for actions. Those that fail their
DEX checks, go after their opponents.

When a character attacks a creature, they must roll below their STR stat
for a Melee Attack or DEX for a Ranged Attack. Likewise, when a creature
attacks, the character must roll below its STR against a Melee Attack
and DEX against a Ranged Attack to avoid taking damage. A GM will often
give the stat required for the check. The damage an attack deals is
based on the character's class or the number of HD a creature has.

To make a Melee Attack an opponent must be Close. Ranged Attacks against
Close opponents are possible, but the attacker suffers a Disadvantage.

Creatures deal damage based on their HD.

If a player making an attack rolls a 1, they double the result of the
damage dice they roll. If they roll a 20 when avoiding an attack, they
take double damage. Armor Points are used normally.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------;
  **Creature HD**              **Roll**              **Damage**
  ---------------------------- --------------------- ---------------------;
  1-3                          1d6                   3

  4-6                          2d6-2                 5

  7                            2d6                   7

  7-10                         2d6+2                 9

 11-12                        3d6                   10
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------;

For every HD above the character's level, add +1 to every roll the
player makes for any attribute check that would determine the outcome of
a conflict between them and an NPC. For example, a level 3 character
defending against a HD 5 creatures attack would add +2 to their roll.

The player should roll an attribute check when any spell, trap or effect
would impact them.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------;
  **Attribute**   **Effect**
  --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------;
  STR             Physical Harm that cannot be avoided

  DEX             Physical Harm that can be avoided

  CON             Poison, Disease or Death.

  INT             Resisting Spells and Magic

  WIS             Deception and Illusions

CHA             Charming effects
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------;

When a character is reduced to zero Hit Points (HP) they are taken Out
of Action (OOA), they are unconscious and cannot make any actions.

## Rest and Healing

When the fight is over/are out of danger, a character that is taken OOA
can roll 2d6 on the table to see what happens to them. If they survive,
they gain 1d6-2 HP.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------;
  Roll
  ---------- ------------------------------------------------------------;
  2          Knocked out

  3-5        Concuss, Disadvantage on all checks for the next hour.

  6-8        Physically Stressed. STR, DEX and CON are -2 for the next
             day.

  9-10       Physically Impaired .STR or DEX is permanently reduced by 2

  11         Disfigured or traumatically shocked - CHA reduced to 4

 12         Dead
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------;

If all the characters lose the fight or are unable to recover the body
of the character, they are lost (Dead)

When characters rest for about an hour, they regain the use of all their
Armor points.

Once per day, after resting, they may roll a Hit Die associated with
their class and regain that many HP.

Characters can gain Hit Points from Spells, Potions, and Abilities. They
can never gain more than their maximum - and can never go below zero
either. When healing a character who is OOA, just start at zero and
count up. That character is now back on their feet and no longer OOA.

## Experience and Gaining Levels

Characters learn through meet objectives and overcoming obstacles.

Killing one Goblin won't bring a revelation or Knowledge. Surviving a
dungeon, completing a quest or simply living to tell the tale will bring
perspective and growth.

GM should be clear and upfront with the player, so they know what the
objectives of the game are. For every session, level, quest or major
event the character survives, it should contribute to gaining a level.
The GM should decide the advancement, it is recommended that the
decision remains mostly constant throughout the campaign.

When a character levels up, their maximum Hit Points increase by rolling
the Hit Die for the class.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------;
  **Class**                           **HP Increase**
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------;
  Combat                              2d6 for STR and DEX.

  Manual                              2d6 for DEX and WIS.

Knowledge                           2d6 for INT or WIS
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------;

A player should roll a 3d6 for each Stat, if the result is higher - that
Stat increases by 1.

## Creatures

HD represents a creature\'s level and the number of d6 rolled to
determine its HP.

Creatures deal damage based on their HD.

For Random creature encounters, roll 1d6 for type and 1d6 for the
creature.

Apply a +/- modifier to change.

## Books & Spells

The Knowledge skill allows the player of the character to use their
faith, innate or learned or abilities to pray or cast a "spell" that is
chosen from a list in their book.

They can cast what they know by reading from a book (or can memorize
from a book) equal to their Level.

They have several \'slots\' that they can cast each day. These represent
a user\'s \'energy\' and the taxing nature of casting. When they run out
of slots, they cannot cast.

Once a spell is cast it should be checked against their WIS/INT - adding
its level to the roll. If they fail, then they reduce the number of
\'slots\' corresponding to the spell level just cast by 1. When a
memorized spell is cast it is not forgotten.

After roughly 8 hours rest, the number of \'slots\' a character has
refreshes to its maximum.

Magic weapons add +1 to any attribute being checked whilst using the
weapon and +1 to each damage dice rolled. More powerful weapons (+2/3)
at the GM discretion.

Magic applies to armor adds to its AP. It operates per the normal AP
rules.

*Traditional OSR games deal with magic items by adding +1 or +2 to
attack rolls and AC. If the GM intends to give out stronger magic armor
(+2/3) to high level players, then consider tripling the Armor Points.*

If a spell calls for a creature to make a save, the character must check
their INT or WIS - to see if the magic cast was powerful enough to
overcome their defenses (remember the Powerful Opponents rule).

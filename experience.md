# Experience and Gaining Levels

Characters learn through meet objectives and overcoming obstacles.

Killing one Goblin won't bring a revelation or Knowledge. Surviving a dungeon, completing a quest or simply living to tell the tale will bring perspective and growth.

GM should be clear and upfront with the player, so they know what the objectives of the game are. For every session, level, quest or major event the character survives, it should contribute to gaining a level. The GM should decide the advancement, it is recommended that the decision remains mostly constant throughout the campaign.

When a character levels up, their maximum Hit Points increase by rolling the Hit Die for the class.

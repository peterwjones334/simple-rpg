# List RPG

This blog provides a barebones generic Fantasy RPG that uses as simple journey to destination structure that is built using lists.

The intent is for the GM to either to quickly pre-plan the adventure end to end, or roll for / select options during the games session. The game mechanics are left to the GM to decide, based on the available materials (Dice, Card, Pencil and Paper), time, preferences, player and their experience..

## GM Materials

1.  **Introduction**: Start with an overview of the adventure module. Briefly describe the setting, the primary goal, and the challenges that the players will face. Provide any necessary background information to help the players understand the situation.
2.  **Background**: Provide additional information on the setting, including any important factions, locations, or NPCs (non-player characters) that will play a role in the adventure. This section should also include any relevant rules or mechanics that will come into play during the adventure.
3.  **Objectives**: Outline the main objectives of the adventure. This might include retrieving an important item, defeating a powerful enemy, or discovering a hidden location. Be sure to provide clear and concise instructions on what the players need to do to achieve their goals.
4.  **Encounters**: Break the adventure down into a series of encounters, each of which presents a challenge for the players to overcome. This might include combat encounters, puzzles to solve, or social interactions with NPCs. Each encounter should be designed to advance the story and help the players achieve their objectives.
5.  **Rewards**: Provide appropriate rewards for the players as they progress through the adventure. This might include treasure, experience points, or other benefits that will help the players advance their characters.
6.  **Conclusion**: Wrap up the adventure with a satisfying conclusion. This might involve defeating a final boss, achieving the primary objective, or discovering a surprising twist in the story. Be sure to tie up any loose ends and provide closure for the players.
7.  **Appendices**: Include any additional resources or information that the players may find helpful. This might include maps, character sheets, or additional background information on the setting or NPCs.

The structure is just a general guide, and you can modify it to fit the needs of your specific adventure.

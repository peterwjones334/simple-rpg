# Books & Spells

The Knowledge skill allows the player of the character to use their faith, innate or learned or abilities to pray or cast a "spell" that is chosen from a list in their book.

They can cast what they know by reading from a book (or can memorize from a book) equal to their Level.

They have several \'slots\' that they can cast each day. These represent a user\'s \'energy\' and the taxing nature of casting. When they run out of slots, they cannot cast.

Once a spell is cast it should be checked against their WIS/INT - adding its level to the roll. If they fail, then they reduce the number of \'slots\' corresponding to the spell level just cast by 1. When a memorized spell is cast it is not forgotten.

After roughly 8 hours rest, the number of \'slots\' a character has refreshes to its maximum.

Magic weapons add +1 to any attribute being checked whilst using the weapon and +1 to each damage dice rolled. More powerful weapons (+2/3) at the GM discretion.

Magic applies to armor adds to its AP. It operates per the normal AP rules.

*Traditional OSR games deal with magic items by adding +1 or +2 to attack rolls and AC. If the GM intends to give out stronger magic armor (+2/3) to high level players, then consider tripling the Armor Points.*

If a spell calls for a creature to make a save, the character must check their INT or WIS - to see if the magic cast was powerful enough to overcome their defenses (remember the Powerful Opponents rule).

Knowledge skills can attempt to banish all nearby undead as an action. They must successfully check their WIS for each group of creatures they are attempting to banish, adding the creature\'s HD to the roll. A GM will determine which creatures are banished. Undead creatures that are Banished must spend all their movement (and convert actions to movement) to move away from the character for 2d4 Moments after being Banished.
